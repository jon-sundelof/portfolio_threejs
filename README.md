# Portfolio

For a long time I have been intrigued by the WebGL technology. Especially after I discovered the Three JS library. Ever since I first discovered Three JS and the opportunity to create a 3 dimensional environment in a simpler way I've had an urge to create a portfolio applying these practises. With that said, this is my attempt at creating my new and improved portfolio.

## Enjoy!
